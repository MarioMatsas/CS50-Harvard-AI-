## Layer 2, Head 2

In this layer the pattern that we can notice is that every token seems to be strongly connected with the one that comes after it.

Example Sentences:
- Hello [MASK] ! How are you?
- My cat greeted me with a loud [MASK].

## Layer 1, Head 4

In this layer notice strong connections near the diagonal. Granted its a bit noisy but we can infer that every token tends to form a strong connection with the word that comes before it.

Example Sentences:
- Hello [MASK] ! How are you?
- My cat greeted me with a loud [MASK].
